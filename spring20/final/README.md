# FINAL PROJECT: CS220 Spring 2020

## Clarifications/Corrections

## This is an individual exam. Do not work with a partner! Only change "submitter" netid information. Good luck.

* Download every file in this directory, except for "netflix_titles.html" (you will write code to download that).
* You need to complete the questions in "Final_Exam.ipynb".
* Read the write up for each question carefully - you will see details about output format and hints in case of difficult questions.
* For majority of the questions you need to replace "# Write your code here" comment with your own code.
* There are 27 questions, each of which will be weighted 0.55 points.
* Unlike projects, you will receive partial credit for a question as long as your code runs and produces an output for each question.
* General hint: if you see a lot of hints / write up before a question, it is likely to be difficult question.
* "test.py" will run lint.py and deduct points for linting errors. You will 0.1 points for each linting error. So check with lint.py before turning your work in. For more information about the linter as well as how to run the full linter to see all of the automatically generated advice and feedback, please check out the [linting README](../../linter).
